# ABSTRACT

The boom of the online game market, the huge percentage of video games focused on cellular gadgets or streaming services, and the increasing complexity of video video games cause the provision of video gamespecific gear to evaluate overall performance and maintainability problems.
This paper proposes Unity Linter, a static evaluation device that support Unity online game builders to hit upon seven varieties of terrible smells we've got diagnosed as applicable in online game development. Such scent sorts pertain to overall performance, maintainability and incorrect conduct problems. After having described the smells via way of means of analyzing the prevailing literature and dialogue forums, we've got assessed their relevance with a survey related to sixty eight participants. Then, we have analyzed the incidence of the studied smells in a hundred opensource Unity projects, and additionally assessed UnityLinterâ€™s accuracy.
Results of our empirical research imply that builders wellreceived overall performance- and conduct-associated troubles, at the same time as some maintainability troubles are greater controversial. UnityLinter is, in general, correct sufficient in detecting smells (86%-a hundred% precision and 50%-a hundred% recall), and our examine suggests that the studied scent sorts arise in 39%-97% of the analyzed project.
