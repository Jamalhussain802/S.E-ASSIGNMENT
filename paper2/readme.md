# ABSTRACT

Developers and computing college students are typically predicted to master more than one programming languages. To analyze a brand new language, builders regularly flip to on-line seek to discover facts and code examples. However, insights on how newbies carry out code seek while running with an surprising language are lacking. Understanding how newbies seek and the demanding situations they encounter while the use of an surprising language can inspire destiny gear and strategies to higher assist next language newbies.
Research on code seek conduct commonly includes monitoring builders at some stage in seek sports thru logs or in situ surveys. We carried out a have a look at on how computing college students look for code in an surprising programming language with 18 graduate college students running on VBA obligations in a lab environment. Our surveys explicitly requested approximately seek fulfillment and question reformulation to gather dependable statistics on the ones metrics. By reading the aggregate of seek logs and survey responses, we located that scholars commonly seek to discover APIs or discover instance code. Approximately 50% of queries that precede clicks on documentation or tutorials correctly solved the problem. Students regularly borrowed phrases from languages with which they may be acquainted while attempting to find examples in an surprising language, however time period borrowing did now no longer impede seek fulfillment. Edit distances among reformulated queries and non-reformulated queries have been almost the same. These outcomes have implications for code seek studies, specifically on reformulation, and for studies on helping programmers while gaining knowledge of a brand new language.
